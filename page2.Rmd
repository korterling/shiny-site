# Introduction

Some text ...

An image ...

![](images/Rlogo.png)

> Note that in shiny applications path references are, by default, relative to the www/ directory. So a path to images/Rlogo.png in an .Rmd document points to www/images/ in the shiny application directory.



## A slider ...

Note that knitr will not render the below as a slider

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(shiny)
sliderInput("slider_test", "This should be another slider", min = 10, max = 100, value = 50)
```

## Another slider

However, if you use renderUI you can get this to work ...

```{r echo = FALSE}
## using renderUI here because Knitr will not create a slider
uiOutput("ui_line")
```
